* **Product managers** drive the development of products. They prioritize initiatives and make strategic decisions about what gets built. They are often considered to be the CEO of a product line.

* **Project managers**, on the other hand, often oversee the execution of plans that have already been developed and approved.

# Project Management

Initiation - Pre-planning phase conceptual phase: Should we do this? Can we do this? Is it possible? 

Planning - Putting together the logistics of actually carrying out a feasible project. 

Execution - The "doing" part of doing a project. 

Control - Also known as monitoring, in this part you as a PM make sure everything goes according to your cunning plan. 

Closure - Exactly what it sounds like and exactly as necessary as you think. 


# Initiation & Planning
Sponsors and Stakeholder(s) are related entities, but slightly different. Sponsors ask for projects to be initiated and stakeholders benefit from a project's completion. 

The Sponsor Interview is crucial to build context for the project, to understand its intention, and to decide how the project can be accomplished as efficiently as possible. Ask all the questions!

## The Iron Triangle:
Time, Cost, and Scope
plus: Risk, Resources, and Quality

consider fixed terms and constraints and their effects

Build a risk tree/list and categorize their likelihood, think about possible solutions to mitigate them

It's important to communicate changes not just to your team, but to sponsors and stakeholders. 

### Time
Ask for percentage of certainty on time estimates. 

PERT - Program Evaluation And Review Technique
(bestest + 4 x most likely + worstest)/6

### Cost
the salaries of the people working on your project and the resources available to them to do their work. 

### Scope
Understanding the scope helps you understand the priorities of your project and helps you plan its execution accordingly. 

## Schedule
Indentify the fixed variable and your plan has to accommodate it.

Creating cards by email

Formatting Tips

When you email a card to Trello, you can immediately add attachments, labels, and members to the card, in addition to setting the title and description.

    The Subject of the email becomes the card's title.
    The Body of the email becomes the card's description.
    Attachments in the email will be added to the card.
    Labels: In the subject, add #labelname, #labelcolor, or #labelnumber
        If your label consists of two or more words, in the subject line either join the words or use underscores between the words. For example, if your label is named "To Do" in the subject line of your email either enter #ToDo or #To_Do for the label to render properly on your card.
        If you have multiple labels in a board with the same color or the same name, emailing a board with #color or #name will only add the first label with that color or name to the card.
    Members: In the subject, add @username. Members can also be added by putting @username in the body of the email on its own line. If you send an email to Trello and include other Trello users' email addresses as "to" or "CC" addresses, Trello will add them as members of the card as well.

Email Comments to Card 

Each card also has its own email– sending a note to this address will make your email show up as a comment. You can find a card's email under the "Share" button on the card back, in the bottom right corner.

# Control
The monitoring or control phase is all about relationships. 

## Leadership
You need to make sure you're following through on your promises, being a person your team trusts, and a securing them the best possible conditions to do their work.

## Communication
It can be useful to have a couple metaphors, analogies, or stories in your pocket to help explain technical concepts and dispel confusion.

The pitfalls of effective communication are assumption and ambiguity. 

The best way to avoid these pitfalls is to practice and encourage Active Listening. Make sure you're focused on the speaker, subtly restate or reinforce their points, and phrase problems and action steps in ways that keep the conversation going. Ask, don't tell. 

## Email
ONA - Optimize, Name, Action
Optimize - This means concise, clear communication.
A good naming protocol is: Date_Client_Issue or Date_Client_Project
action your team needs to take and the timeline for that action step (Highlight)

The time-sensitive informationprobably shouldn't have been conveyed via email. 
Email can be used as summary of conversation.

## Meeting
Prepare a plan - a list of items not just to cover but conquer. 

Imagine condensing the time of your meeting by half. 

Once you're in a meeting, you need to make sure it's the environment that's most effective for you to convey your information. So step up and lead it! Cultivate respect and facilitate active listening.

If people are usually on their phones or laptops, don't allow laptops or phones. You set the terms. 

The most important thing to keep in mind about making meetings productive is that they should end with action. Go over steps in the room and make sure your team are all on the same page. 

## When Everything is On Fire
Stay calm. It's more important to appear calm and solution-oriented than anything else. 

The big step is to assess and define the problem. How is it going to affect your constraints? How can you work within your framework to solve the issues? What are you options? Is it time for the blame game? No. No it isn’t.

Keep your team in the loop. Communication doesn't stop because something went wrong. Put all possible solutions out on the table, and hone in on the best ones which will keep the project on its feet. Always move forward until the problem is solved. 

# What Could Possibly Go Wrong?
Scope Creep: when a project slowly gets bigger or more ambiguous. Prevent it with pre-plan and call it out to your team and your sponsors when you see it. 

Schedules: are the most likely thing to break down, so have some flexibility built into them when planning. You need to assess changes and honestly put it out there if you need help. 

Lack Of Resources/Change In Resources: this is especially a risk for long term projects. It'll be your job to come up with contingencies when this happens. 

Disagreements: whether they're between sponsors, stakeholders, or members of your team, it's your job to help smooth these out and find the compromises that will keep everyone on track. Always project the integrity of the project.

Stupid Or Impossible Demands: these happen. And while you can't fix stupid, you at least have to do your best to find a sensical solution. 

## Change Requests
Plan a process to deal with changes.

CRs - Change Requests. Can be more or less formal. But it's important before the project begins your team understands how the change process will work. Before a change is implemented, always double-check its feasibility with your team. 

Keep the project’s lifespan in mind. Change is always harder the closer you are to completion. 

## Closing
Make sure you review the final deliverables, as these may have changed from your original conception.
close-out WBS

Do post-mortem reviews of the project: with your team, with your sponsors, and with yourself. Find what how whatever went wrong happened, but also find successes as well.
