#Software 2.0
Artificial intelligence can be defined as Software 2.0, which means it is nothing less than a software but such software has a capability to learn and change its behaviour oevrtime. 

#Problems
* Consider The Legal, Privacy and Ethical Requirements For Testing AI System
* Test Data To Test AI Algorithms
* Same Input But Different Output Than Before
* Outputs Management Are Critical
* Regression Testing: the regression testing may not be that productive unless it is done for a net new AI machine.

#How to Test
* **A/B testing** two different versions of their software and test the user’s reaction
* **Testing the input values** Different kinds of input values can lead to expected and unexpected behavior; need data validation
* **Feeding specific input data to see how the AI learns** feed the AI with specific data to change its behavior
* **Metamorphic testing** to alleviate the test oracle problem
A test oracle is the mechanism by which a tester can determine whether a system reacts correctly. A test oracle problem occurs when it is difficult to determine the expected outcomes of selected test cases or to determine whether the actual outputs accord with the expected outcomes.
* **Testing the nonfunctional requirements** like performance, security and privacy 
* **Systems Integration Testing** when multiple AI systems with conflicting goals are deployed together
