Error State Kalman Filter solves an approximate problem with exact solutions by recasting the problem from state domain to error-state domain.

Internal Sensors: gyroscopes, acclerometers and magnetometers
Exernal Sensors: GPS
Strapdown Inertial Sensors
Inetial Navigation Systems(INS): Dead Reckoning

Attitude Estimation Problem:
dynamic modeling
$\begin{bmatrix}
   phi\\
   theta\\
   psy
\end{bmatrix}$
